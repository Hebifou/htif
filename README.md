Overview

HTIF (How The Internet Feels) is an AI-based system that explores how digital culture feels — not just what it says.  

It reveals emotional dynamics, cultural signals, and narrative shifts hidden in online conversations.

HTIF measures resonance, ambivalence, and meaning.  

It’s designed for brands, media, and researchers who want to understand the why behind public reaction.
